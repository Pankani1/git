        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a free and open-source version control system designed to handle
          everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
          It's a command-line tool that allows developers to track changes made to
          their codebase over time. With Git, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a history of changes made to your code</li>
          <li>Collaborate with others on a project</li>
          <li>Manage different versions of your code</li>
          <li>Roll back to previous versions if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub is a web-based platform that offers a user-friendly interface for
          Git. It's a place where developers can host and manage their Git
          repositories, making it easier to collaborate with others and share code
          with the world. With GitHub, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and manage repositories (repos) for your projects</li>
          <li>Invite others to collaborate on your projects</li>
          <li>Share your code with the world</li>
          <li>Discover and contribute to open-source projects</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Git and GitHub Work Together</h2>
        <p>Here's a step-by-step overview of how Git and GitHub work together:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a Git repository: You create a new Git repository on your local
            machine using the <code>git init</code> command.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add files to Git: You add your project files to the Git repository using
            the <code>git add </code>command.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit changes: You commit your changes to the Git repository using the
            <code>git commit</code> command.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a GitHub repository: You create a new repository on GitHub and
            link it to your local Git repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Push changes to GitHub: You push your committed changes to the GitHub
            repository using the <code>git push</code> command.
